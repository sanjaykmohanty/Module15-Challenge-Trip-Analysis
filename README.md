# Module15-Challenge-Trip-Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to use Citi Bike data and examine if a similar bike sharing program would be a viable business in another city. Citi Bike data is used to examine the following:
- How many people use Citi Bike
- When people ride
- Total distance people cover in their rides
- Gender breakdown of people using bikes
- Most rides are taken on what days of the week

## Results
Trip Analysis Dashboard can be viewed using the [Tableau link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sanjay.mohanty/viz/Module15Challenge-TripAnalysis/Popularridetimesoftheday?publish=yes)

The analysis was done for a total of 2,344,224 trips.

**Maximum check out duration**

**Bike repair schedule**

Bike repair can be planned based on the use of the bike. Bikes used the most may need more repair.

In a sample of 2,334,224 customers, it was observed that 1,530,272 were male customers, 588,431 were female customers and 225,521 customer's gender was unknown. This data confirms that men use citi bike more than women.

## Summary
Citi Bike trip analysis provides a a great deal of insight into what needs to be considered while starting a similar program in another city. In the month of august there were a total of 2,344,224 bike rides. Most of the Citi Bike customers had short rides, generally less than 60 minutes. Subscribers are the main contributors to the business. A closer look at the results suggests that men contribute to this business more than women. The location of the bike repair station must be chosen based on customer volume, and frequency and duration of bike use. 

Additional visualizations that would help the purpose are:
- Top starting and ending locations would help keeping right inventory in right locations
- Bike utilization would help in prioritizing bikes for repair - Bikes making frequent longer duration trips need frequent repairs
